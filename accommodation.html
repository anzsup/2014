<h2>Accommodation</h2>

<p>Summer school attendees are responsible for securing their own
accommodation.  Here are a few options which provide easy access to
the <a href="venue.html">venue</a>.</p>

<h3>The Glenferrie Hotel</h3>

<p>The Glenferrie Hotel is just across the road from the Hawthorn
campus of SUT and offers a higher standard of accommodation but at a
higher price than the other options listed. This would be appropriate
accommodation for attendees travelling with family.</p>

<h3>Other options</h3>

<p>As the Hawthorn campus of SUT is only a 15 minute train ride from
the Melbourne CBD, many of the city backpacker hostels could also
provide appropriate accommodation. The following would both be
ideal:</p>
