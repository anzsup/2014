<h2>Summer School Venue</h2>
</div>

<p>The third Victorian Summer School in Ultracold Atomic Physics will be held in Swinburne University of Technology, <a href="http://www.swinburne.edu.au/cwis/maps/maps_hawthorn.htm">Hawthorn campus</a>, a suburb of Melbourne ~7 km East of the city centre.
Melbourne Tullamarine International airport is ~25 km NW of the city centre.</p>

<p>The workshop will be held in EN615, the lecture room of the <a href="http://www.swinburne.edu.au/optics/caous">Centre for Atom Optics and Ultrafast Spectroscopy</a> on the sixth floor of the EN building (~3 min walk from the Glenferrie station).
For more details, see <a href="http://www.swinburne.edu.au/engineering/caous/location.htm">Getting to CAOUS</a>.</p>

<h3>Arrival</h3>

<h4>By public transport</h4>

<p>The only public transport available from the airport is the <a href="http://www.skybus.com.au/">Skybus Super Shuttle</a> which runs every 10&ndash;20 minutes from the airport to <a href="http://ptv.vic.gov.au/stop/view/22180">Southern Cross</a> train station on Spencer Street in the city (and vice versa), taking ~20 mins. You can book and print the ticket in advance.</p>
<p>The closest train station to the University is <a href="http://ptv.vic.gov.au/stop/view/19904">Glenferrie</a>, which is actually located on the campus and served by the Belgrave, Lilydale and Alamein lines; trains run from <a href="http://ptv.vic.gov.au/stop/view/19854">Flinders Street</a> station in the city to Glenferrie every ~15 minutes during the day.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Try not to fly to Melbourne Avalon airport (this is where Jetstar flies into from Sydney) &mdash; it is twice as distant from the city as Tullamarine.</p>

<h4>By taxi</h4>

<p>A taxi from the airport to the University costs about $70.</p>
